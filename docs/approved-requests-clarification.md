# Approved Requests Clarification

## Issue
The "Approved" requests count on the dashboard was showing requests where individual users had approved something during the workflow, rather than requests that had been fully approved by the Chairman.

## Clarification
**"Approved Requests" = Only requests with status `APPROVED` (fully approved by Chairman)**

This means requests that have completed the entire approval workflow and received final approval from the Chairman.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Stats API (`app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const approvedRequests = visibleRequests.filter(req => 
  req._visibility.category === 'approved' || 
  (req._visibility.category === 'in_progress' && req._visibility.userAction === 'approve')
).length;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Approved requests = only requests that have been fully approved by Chairman
const approvedRequests = visibleRequests.filter(req => 
  req.status === RequestStatus.APPROVED
).length;
```

### 2. Requests API (`app/api/requests/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
} else if (status === 'approved') {
  visibleRequests = visibleRequests.filter(req => 
    req._visibility.category === 'approved' || 
    (req._visibility.category === 'in_progress' && req._visibility.userAction === 'approve')
  );
```

**After:**
```typescript
} else if (status === 'approved') {
  // Approved requests = only requests that have been fully approved by Chairman
  visibleRequests = visibleRequests.filter(req => req.status === RequestStatus.APPROVED);
```

### 3. Dashboard UI (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Updated description:**
```typescript
description: currentUser?.role === 'requester' 
  ? 'View my fully approved requests' 
  : 'View fully approved requests (Chairman approved)',
```

## Impact

### Dashboard Stats
- **Total Requests**: Shows all requests user can see (unchanged)
- **Pending**: Shows requests awaiting user's action (unchanged)
- **Approved**: Now shows only Chairman-approved requests
- **Rejected**: Shows rejected requests (unchanged)
- **In Progress**: Shows requests user has worked on that are still in workflow (unchanged)

### Request Filtering
When users click "Approved" or filter by approved status, they will only see requests that have completed the entire workflow and been approved by the Chairman.

### User Experience
- **Requesters**: Can see which of their requests have been fully approved
- **Approvers**: Can see which requests in the system have been fully approved
- **Clear distinction**: Between "I approved this" vs "This is fully approved"

## Workflow Status Hierarchy

1. **Pending**: Requests awaiting action at current user's level
2. **In Progress**: Requests user has acted on but still moving through workflow
3. **Approved**: Requests that have completed entire workflow (Chairman approved)
4. **Rejected**: Requests that were rejected at any stage

## Benefits

1. **Clear semantics**: "Approved" now has a clear, unambiguous meaning
2. **Better tracking**: Users can distinguish between partial and complete approvals
3. **Accurate reporting**: Dashboard stats reflect actual completion status
4. **Consistent filtering**: All approved filters work the same way

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The approved requests clarification has been implemented. "Approved" now consistently means requests that have been fully approved by the Chairman across all dashboard stats and filtering.
